##Functional Specification
_Rancor Team_

#Overview
__Rancor__ is a ranked choice service that allows people to coordinate basic voting to based on ranked choice voting.

__This spec tries to keep up with the project, but will never be complete.__ All of this information will need to be revised several times over the lifetime of the project, and will evolve as needed. The graphics and layout are merely guidlines and might not match the final product.

This spec will not go into technical detail. That will be covered in another documents. It simply discusses the way the end user is meant to experience and interact with rancor.
